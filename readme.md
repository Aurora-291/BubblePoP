# Bubble PoP
A little game i made where you just pop bubbles its super simple but also addictive. you just click on the bubble that float up and try to get a high score.
* you just click on them to try and get a high score
* you can change lots of stuff like the speed and size of the bubbles
* and the colors too there is rainbow pastel and other ones
* there is also powerups that let you build up a power meter for a big screen-clearing pop
* it has a dark mode becuase everything should have a dark mode

## Why i made this
* i wanted to make something more interactive that i could mess with
* so i added the controls for speed and size so you can make it as easy or as hard as you want
* i also thought just popping bubbles was ok but a big reward would be cool so i made up the power mode thing
* it was mostly a project for fun to see if i could make something simple feel really satisfying

## How i made it
* its all just plain html css and javascript i didnt use any big frameworks
* the bubbles are just html divs that i make using a javascript function
* i use a javascript thing called setInterval its like a repeating timer that tells the browser to make a new bubble every second or whatever the speed is set to
* the high score saves even if you close the page which is cool
* i used localStorage for that its like a little storage box in you're browser where i can keep a note of the high score
*   the dark and light theme just flips a switch on the page and the css has different colors ready for it

## Struggles and what i have learned
* speed control was a nightmare at first when i changed speeds it would just add a new timer on top of the old one
* the screen would just fill up with a million bubbles it was total chaos lol
* i learned you have to properly clear the old timer before making a new one
* making it look good on a phone was also a strugle i always forget to do that until the end
* i learned i should probably think about mobile screens from the start and not as an afterthought
* i also learned that the little things like the pop animation and the acheivement popup make a huge difference it's not just about if the code works but if its fun to actually use

## Usage of AI
* used ai to solve my errors which are not known how to solve by me
* used ai for formating the code like alignment and arrangement
* used ai in few parts of readme file when i dont know to convey what im trying to convey
